#Persona:#

Name: Likhanya Cele
Age: 18
Occupation: Student
Education: Grade 11, currently doing grade 12

Goals:
- Find information on different courses
- Know necessary requirements needed for different courses
- Finding a platform that has all information Likhanya is interested in

Motivation:
- Likhanya would like to attend one of the best Universities,
- Likhanya would like know the necessary requirements so she has a goal to work towards in all her subjects and overall aggregate 

Frustrations:
- As a high school learner Likhanya is unfamiliar with terminology used by tertiary institutions
- Likhanya finds it difficult to keep up with all the different tertiary institution websites and would appreciate a single platform with all necessary information 
- Likhanya finds it hard to navigate through certain webpages and would like a simple, easy to navigate Graphical User Interface 

#Scenario:#

Likhanya Cele is a focused Grade 12 student in South Africa who is determined and passionate about her future. She is determined to make it in the STEM field and would love to study at one of the top Universities in the country. However she is not sure which course to go into or what marks she needs to obtain to be considered for the course that she eventually chooses. 

Likhanya searches for a platform that has information on STEM fields and all the universities that have programs within this field. Likhanya finds STEMify. When Likhanya discovers this platform she uses her details to sign up. When she has successfully signed up on the STEMify platform she is then able to log in. A username and password is entered by Likhanya which takes her to a landing page which will ask Likhanya if she is a High School learner or Tertiary student (as STEMify caters to both). Once Likhanya selects the High School option she will be asked to input more details such as, what grade she is in, what are her interests (this helps narrow down programs she might be interested in). There will also be an interactive quiz that will further help narrow the search. Once Likhanya has an idea of the courses she would be interested in she can search for the courses on the platform to find more detailed information such as, APS score needed and the career paths one can go into. With this platform Likhanya will be able to find all necessary information in one place. 

#User Story:#
Likhanya Cele is an ambitious 18-year-old Grade 12 student who dreams of attending one of the best universities in South Africa. With a strong desire to succeed, she wants to ensure she meets all the necessary academic requirements for the courses she's interested in. However, the process of researching university programs is overwhelming—every university has a different website layout, academic jargon is unfamiliar, and navigating through all this information while preparing for final exams is stressful.

To support her goals, Likhanya begins using a student-friendly career guidance platform designed specifically for learners like her (STEMify). Upon logging into the platform, she is greeted with a clean and intuitive interface that doesn’t require complex technical skills to navigate.

Curious about a career in Computer Science, Likhanya types "Computer Science" into the course search bar. The platform displays a list of universities that offer the program, along with clearly listed subject requirements, minimum APS scores, and extra notes like whether she needs to take a National Benchmark Test (NBT). A glossary feature pops up whenever she hovers over confusing terms, instantly explaining them in everyday language. This helps her understand what “NQF Level 7” or “Faculty of Natural Science” actually mean.

The platform also has a recommendation engine. Based on her marks, interests, and subjects, it suggests other programs that align with her strengths—such as Physical Sciences and Mathematics —offering her more options she hadn’t considered before. Each recommended course includes a "What You’ll Need" section, summarizing requirements and helpful advice like improving Life Sciences or writing a strong motivational letter.

Thanks to the platform’s centralized, API-driven structure behind the scenes, all the data is accurate and up-to-date, pulled from official university websites in real-time. Likhanya doesn’t need to jump between multiple sources or dig through outdated PDFs. Everything she needs is in one place.

Feeling more confident, she sets goals for each subject based on what she now knows is required.What once felt confusing and intimidating now feels manageable and clear.

Through this simple but powerful software, Likhanya gains clarity, direction, and peace of mind—helping her stay motivated and focused as she works towards her academic dreams.

He has completed modules such as Quantum Mechanics, Electrodynamics, Modern Physics, C++, Java, Complex Analysis. 
He is curious in pursuing theoretical physics more especially work dealing with quantum algorithms/ quantum gravity and he is looking for guidance on how he can pursue this field and what he may need to do.
Navigate to the STEMify page/app

Search for Astrophysics. 
Receives a “Career overview card” for “Astrophysics” which gives a description of what the field is, something along the lines of, “Astrophysics is a branch of astronomy that uses principles of chemistry and physics to study phenomena above the sun and to understand the universe and its contents. These physicists may work in observatories such as SALT and SKA studying these phenomena.”

Education path

The following may not necessarily be available at your institution but if you have a few of these you will be better off than an individual who did not take any. They may also be under different names or elements of these modules are included in some of the modules you take and the rest could be learned as an application/self study.
Undergraduate: Modern Physics, Solid State Physics, Ordinary Differential Equations, Linear Algebra, General Relativity, Statistical Physics, Scientific Computing, Statistics.

Post-graduate: Honours in Physics which includes General Relativity, Cosmology, Mathematical Physics or any relevant Astronomy modules.

User Story and Scenario

Thabo is a first-year Computer Science student who recently discovered a passion for coding after building a basic website in one of his introductory classes. Although he's excited about programming, he often feels uncertain about his future in tech. He lacks confidence in mathematics and isn't enrolled in any statistics modules, which makes him question whether he truly belongs in the field.

One day, Thabo learns about a STEM career guidance app designed to help high school and undergraduate students explore career paths tailored to their interests and strengths. Curious and hopeful, he downloads the app and creates an account.

After selecting his education level and field of study, Thabo completes a short quiz assessing his interests, skills, and academic background. He shares that he enjoys building websites, solving problems with code, and working with creative design tools like Figma. However, he admits that math-heavy subjects are a challenge.

Based on his responses, the app recommends several career paths aligned with his profile: Front-End Developer, UI/UX Designer, and QA Tester. Thabo is especially intrigued by the Front-End Developer role. He taps into the suggested pathway and is greeted with a detailed overview of the profession. 
The app explains how front-end developers build the visual and interactive parts of websites and applications, highlighting the importance of HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and frameworks like React.
The app presents a structured learning roadmap, from beginner to professional, and suggests university modules and online courses to help him build the required skills. What truly resonates with Thabo, though, are the featured success stories—accounts of students who, like him, once doubted their math abilities but pursued front-end development successfully through creativity, persistence, and community support.

Inspired and motivated, Thabo saves the front-end development path to his profile and enrolls in a beginner-friendly JavaScript course recommended by the app. He also joins his university’s coding club to meet like-minded peers and start building real-world projects.

With a clearer sense of direction and growing confidence, Thabo begins to envision a future in tech that plays to his strengths, fuels his creativity, and gives him purpose.
